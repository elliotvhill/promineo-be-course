This lesson contains Questions 11-20 (Part 2) of the OpenClass Methods Lesson, and contains five (5) coding questions, each followed by a mastery question.

## 1. `createArray` Method

Complete the method that accepts five integer values stored in the variables a, b, c, d, e.
In the method, you will create an Array of int that stores the value of the five parameters
Here is a reminder of a two ways to declare an array:
   int[] arrayName = new int[10];   // An Array of int called arrayName that is of size 10
   int[] arrayName2 = {value1, value2}; // An Array of int called arrayName2 which contains 2 items
The method should return the Array

avgNameLength Method

Given a method call avgNameLength that takes in an Array of String stored in names, write a program that will traverse the Array.
The names Array will hold 5 names that are entered by the user
Here is a reminder of how to access an element in an array:
    // if arrayName is an Array of String
    arrayName[index] // This will access the String located in arrayName at index
    arrayName[0] // This will access the first String in arrayName -- remember that Arrays are zero-indexed
    arrayName[0].length() // This will give the length of the String stored in location zero (0)
The method avgNameLength will traverse the Array and find the average length of all the names that are part of names
Return the average length of all the names
