# Week 11: MySQL â€” Many to Many, Update, Delete

Notes from the week 11 MySQL lecture videos.

## Overview

-   MySQL functions:

    -   **Math** functions
    -   **Text** functions
    -   **Date/timme** functions

-   Coding the many-to-many relationship:

    -   Write code to properly insert categories using the join table
    -   Using a subquery

-   More CRUD:

    -   `UPDATE <table> SET`
    -   `DELETE FROM <table>`
    -   A **real-life** look at `ON DELETE CASCADE`

-   A brief look at Streams:

    -   Fetch, sort, and return all in **one** statement
    -   Streams are ultimately **elegant**
    -   Streams are initially **confusing**
