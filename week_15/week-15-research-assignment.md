## Prompts

### Spring Boot:

1. Research Spring Boot vs. Spring. Describe each. How do they relate? Why do we use Spring Boot?

    > Spring is a framework for building Java applications, providing tools for dependency injection, security, and other features. Spring Boot is a layer of functionality built on top of Spring that simplifies setup and configuration by handling the majority of the boilerplate code. We use Spring Boot because it reduces complexity, saves time, and it also includes an embedded server. <sup>[[2](#source-2)]</sup>

2. What are the annotations used for CRUD operations in Spring Boot?

    > Spring Boot uses the annotations `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, and `@DeleteMapping` to handle HTTP requests for CRUD operations. These correspond to the HTTP methods `GET` ("read"), `POST` ("create"), `PUT` ("update"), and `DELETE` ("delete"), respectively. <sup>[[1](#source-1)]</sup>

3. Describe the difference between Hibernate & Spring Boot JPA

4. What is Tomcat? How does it relate to Spring Boot?
