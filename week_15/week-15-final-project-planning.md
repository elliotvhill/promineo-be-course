# Week 15: REST API #2 — Final Project Planning

**Week 15:**  This is the week to plan and prepare for  your **Final Project**

1.  You will have this week to plan, design & get your project **approved by your Instructor or by your mentor** — Week 15.  **Start Now!**

2.  You will have 3 weeks for implementation & debugging — Weeks 16-18.

3.  Notice the tile below: **Week 15: Final Project Proposal Prep —** Click on **Week 15: Final Project Proposal Prep**, and read through the requirements for the **Final Project!**

-   Decide whether to do a Group Project, or an Individual Project.

-   Talk through your ideas with your mentor. Ask questions in class & in Office Hours.

-   Create an **ERD** of your project idea, and think through what you want to implement for your **CRUD**.

    -   Do you want to **Create** every entity with it's own @PostMapping?

    -   Does every entity need a **Delete** (e.g. @DeleteMapping)?

    -   What about **Update** (e.g. @PutMapping) and **Read** (e.g. @GetMapping)?

    -   Remember the Requirements for an Individual Project:

        -   Design your MySQL Database with a minimum of 3 tables and at least one 1-to-many relationships (PK/FK), and at least one many-to-many relationship (join table).

        -   Implement the following:  every entity/table needs at least one CRUD Operation, at least one table/entity needs all 4 CRUD Operations, AND your many-to-many needs to have CRUD Operations on that relationship.

        -   **Required**:  **REST Web API Server** tested through Swagger, Postman or AdvancedRestClient (ARC) or a front-end client.

-   Remember the Requirements for a Group Project:

    -   Design your MySQL Database with a minimum of 2 tables per Group Member, and 1 additional table.  At least one 1-to-many relationships (PK/FK), and at least one many-to-many relationship (join table).

    -   Implement the following:  every entity/table needs at least one CRUD Operation, at least one table/entity needs all 4 CRUD Operations, AND your many-to-many needs to have CRUD Operations on that relationship.

    - **Required**:  **REST Web API Server** tested through Swagger, Postman or AdvancedRestClient (ARC) or a front-end client.

    -   Each Group Member needs to implement  at minimum their 2 tables/entities top to bottom including the entity, controller, service & dao/repository layers

    -   Each Group Member must document and submit their contributions.  **Each member is required to include** a 5-minute video containing an overview of the whole project, AND specifically their implementation/contribution, with their part working!

-   We recommend creating this project with JPA following the design of one of these projects:  **pet-parks**, **dog-rescue**, or **pet-store**.
