# Week 16: Career Services Assignment — Get ready for technical interviews

As a back end developer, you may encounter different types of technical interviews during your job search. It’s a bit difficult to predict which format you may encounter and in what order because every hiring manager is different, but here is an overview to help you prepare for what you might expect:

-   **Trivia questions** — This is often the first stage of technical interviewing. An interviewer may ask about fundamental topics such as Java, SQL, and database design. For example, a question may ask the developer to describe the difference between a primary key and a foreign key in a relational database.

-   **Take-home test** — The interviewer will send you a coding project to complete on your own time. The project could involve building a database schema, implementing a feature, or fixing a bug. This type of interview allows you to work at your own pace and showcase your skills in a low-pressure environment.

-   **Timed problem-solving challenge** — You would be given a set of coding challenges to solve within a set timeframe, such as an hour or two. This type of interview tests your ability to work under pressure and solve problems quickly and efficiently.

-   **Coding live while screen sharing** — This interview is usually toward the end of the hiring process. The interviewer will ask you to solve a coding problem or implement a feature while they watch. This type of interview allows the interviewer to see how you approach problem-solving, how you work with code, and how you communicate your thought process. In this case, you might be asked to write Java code or SQL queries to solve the problem or implement the feature.

**For this assignment, we are focusing on the trivia questions.**
