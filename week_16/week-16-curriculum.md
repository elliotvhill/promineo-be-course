### Recap — week 15:

-   Started **Dog Rescue** REST API
-   Created the Maven/Spring Boot project

-   Created JPA **entities**
-   Created `schema.sql` (to create tables) and `data.sql` (to populate tables)
-   Set up the JPA configuration
-   **Coded** the "Create Location" operation

### What's happening in week 16:

-   Fill out **CRUD** operations for dog rescue locations
-   Create rows in the **dog** table
-   Delete location and show that it deletes dog child rows as well
-   Write **integration tests** for all operations
    -   _Next video:_ we will create an integration test for the "Create Location" operation. We will use the H2 **in-memory** database for the tests and set the data to a known state before each test.
