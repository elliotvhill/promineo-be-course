# Week 4 Research Assignment

## Purpose

* This Research Assignment is meant to go beyond the course curriculum and increase your understanding of relevant topics while exposing you to online resources you'll frequently use on the job. 
* As developers, research is a constant part of our job. 
* A common saying is that 90% of software development is "Googling".  While that is an exaggeration, search engines are highly utilized tools in the software development role.   
* The Java Documentation is a great place to start, and there are so many other great resources!


## Instructions

* Choose at least two (2) of the 5 numbered prompts below.
* Research those prompts.
* Write at least one paragraph for two (2) of the prompts below
* Include URLs from where you found the information to cite your sources. 
* Submit your Research Results to the LMS.

## Prompts

### Strings

1. Select five (5) methods from the [**String Java Documentation**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) and describe the following for each: 

    (a) What is the method signature for each method?

    (b) What does each method do? 

    (c) Why would this method be useful (how could you use it)?  Give an example.


### Arrays

2. Select five (5)  methods from the [**Array Java Documentation**](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/reflect/Array.html) and describe the following for each: 

    (a) What is the method signature for each method?

    (b) What does each method do? 

    (c) Why would this method be useful (how could you use it)? Give an example.


### Collections 

Resource: [**Java Tutorials on Interfaces**](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/interfaces/index.html)

3. What are the differences between Lists, Sets, and Maps in Java?

4. List at least two different implementations for each collection (List, Set, and Map). When would you use one of the implementations over the other?

5. Write Java code that does the following:

    (a) Write a line of code that shows how you would instantiate an ArrayList of String.

    (b) Write a line of code that shows how you would instantiate a HashSet of StringBuilder.

    (c) Write a line of code that shows how you would instantiate a HashMap of String, String.
