## Prompts

1. How do web APIs work? Why are they useful?

    > Web APIs send requests over the internet. A common analogy is that an API is like the waiter in a restaurant -- they take orders (requests) and pass them to the kitchen (server) and return with your food (response). APIs provide a standardized way for applications to communicate with one another and share information. This is useful because it means developers don't have to write _everything_ from scratch -- they can use an existing resource by using an API and thus save time and effort.<sup>[[3]](#source-3)</sup>

2. Look up 3 different public web APIs online and describe 3 endpoints from each.

    In your description include the following:

    - (a) The URI (or endpoint)

    - (b) All of the HTTP verb methods that can be sent to that endpoint.

    - (c) A description of what happens when each verb method is sent.

3. What does REST stand for? What is REST? What are some of the key concepts that identify REST?

    > **REST** stands for **Re**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer. <sup>[[1]](#source-1)</sup><sup>[[2]](#source-2)</sup>

4. What is Maven? Why do we use Maven? What problems does Maven help solve?

5. What is Swagger? Why would you use Swagger? What can be done with Swagger?

6. What is ARC? Why would you use ARC? What can you do with ARC?

7. What is Postman? Why would you use Postman? What can be done with Postman?

    > Postman is a software application used to develop, test, and manage APIs. It has integrated tools thatÂ allow developers to make HTTP requests (including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), view status codes, manage authentication, and more.<sup>[[4]](#source-4)[[5]](#source-5)</sup>
