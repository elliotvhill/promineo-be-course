# Week 10 Coding Assignment

Instructions for week 10 coding assignment.

## Background

We have been developing a menu-driven application that demonstrates how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Read) operations on a DIY project database. Thus far, we have learned how to create a connection to a MySQL database and how to insert records into a table. In this section, we will apply our knowledge of querying data to list all projects without project details, and to list a single project with all details.

## Objectives

In these exercises, you will expand the menu application to list all projects (name and ID). Then, you will write code to select a project to edit. This will involve returning a selected project along with all project details. This will further our pursuit of implementing CRUD operations on database tables.

In these exercises, you will:

-   Hone your SQL query skills by writing SQL statements to fetch a List of Project records.

-   Learn how to perform multiple queries in a single transaction.

-   Write an inner join to fetch category rows related to a project row.

-   Use an Optional to either return a project record or to throw a custom Exception.

-   Practice writing Lambda expressions both to list the projects and to throw a custom Exception from an Optional.

**Important:** In the exercises below, you will see this icon: :camera: .

This means to make sure that you include this functionality in your video showcase.

Also important: you should take the variable names and method names as suggestions. They're good suggestions, but if you want to deviate from them, feel free to do so. However, don't go crazy and change `listProjects()` to `emptyMyBankAccountByBuyingAJeep()`. You should follow Java best practices. Method names should describe what the method does in the interest of self-documentation.

## Instructions

Follow the **Exercises** below to complete this assignment.

-   In Eclipse, or an IDE of your choice, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below. Ensure that the code compiles and runs as directed.

-   Using the repository you created in week 7, push your completed code to this dedicated repo, including your entire Maven Project Directory (e.g., `mysql-java`) and any `.sql` files that you create. In addition, screenshot your ERD and push the screenshot to your GitHub repo.

-   Include the functionality into your Video when you see: :camera:

-   Create a video showcasing your work:

    -   In this video: record and present your project verbally while showing the results of the working project. Donâ€™t forget to include the requested functionality, indicated by:

    -   **_Easy way to Create a video:_** Start a meeting in Zoom, share your screen, open Eclipse with the code and your Console window, start recording & record yourself describing and running the program showing the results. When you click "End Meeting" it will save the video on your computer.

    -   Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.

    -   This video should be done using screen share and voice over.

    -   This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube. Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!

    -   (If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.)

### Exercises

Complete these exercises as directed. If you get hopelessly stuck, please see the "Solutions" section below.

In these exercises, you will often be told to call a method prior to creating it. This is a good approach. You set up the return type by assigning it to a variable and setting up the parameters. Then, Eclipse can correctly create the method.

## List projects

In this section, you will add code to return and print a list of projects. Several application methods will call this method to let the user select a project from a list. To get the list of projects, you will add the menu option and method in the menu class, then you will add a method in the service class. The DAO class will perform the actual work of fetching the list using JDBC method calls.

### Modifications to menu app

In this section you will add another option to the list of available options. Then you will add another case to the switch method along with the method to call the service to retrieve the list of projects.

In this section, you will be working in `ProjectsApp.java`.

1. Add this line to the list of operations at the top of `ProjectsApp.java`: `"2) List projects"`.

2. Add `case 2` to the switch statement in `processUserSelection()`. In the case, call method `listProjects()`. Don't forget to add the `break` statement.

3. Have Eclipse create the method `listProjects()`. It should take no parameters and should return nothing. In the method:

    &emsp;a. Create a variable to hold a `List` of `Project`s named `projects`. Assign the variable the results of a method call to `projectService.fetchAllProjects()`.

    &emsp;b. Print "`\nProjects:`" (without quotes) to the console.

    &emsp;c. For each `Project`, print the ID and name separated by "`: `". Indent each line with a couple of spaces.

    &emsp;<details><summary>d. At this point, the method should look like this:</summary>

    ```java
    private void listProjects() {
        List<Project> projects = projectService.fetchAllProjects();

        System.out.println("\nProjects:");

        projects.forEach(project -> System.out.println(
            "    " + project.getProjectId()
            + ": " + project.getProjectName()));
    }
    ```

    </details>

    &emsp;e. Have Eclipse create the method `fetchAllProjects()` in the `ProjectService` class, or create it yourself.

    &emsp;f. Save all files. At this point the project should have no errors.

### Modifications to project service

You need to fill in the method in the service class to call the DAO class. This method will simply return the results of the method call to the DAO class. The service class in our small application does not do very much. But it allows us to properly separate concerns of input/output, business logic, and database reads and writes. If you always structure your code like this it will be much easier to understand and make changes if needed.

In this section, you will be working in `ProjectService.java`.

1. In the method `fetchAllProjects`, call the `fetchAllProjects()` method on the `projectDao` object.

2. Have Eclipse create the method `fetchAllProjects()` in `ProjectDao.java` or create it yourself. It takes no parameters and returns a `List` of `Project`s.

### Modifications to project dao

Now you need to write the code to retrieve all the projects from the database. It is structured similarly to the `insertProject()` method, but it will also incorporate a `ResultSet` to retrieve the project row(s).

To implement this method, first you will write the SQL statement that instructs MySQL to return all project rows without any materials, steps, or categories. Then, you will obtain a `Connection` and start a transaction. Next, you will obtain a `PreparedStatement` from the `Connection` object. Then, you will get a `ResultSet` from the `PreparedStatement`. Finally, you will iterate over the `ResultSet` to create a `Project` object for each row returned.

In this section, you will be working in `ProjectDao.java`.

1. In the method `fetchAllProjects()`:

    &emsp;a. Write the SQL statement to return all projects not including materials, steps, or categories. Order the results by project name.

    &emsp;b. Add a `try-with-resource` statement to obtain the `Connection` object. Catch the `SQLException` in a `catch` block and rethrow a `new DbException`, passing in the `SQLException` object.

    &emsp;c. Inside the `try` block, start a new transaction.

    &emsp;d. Add an inner `try-with-resource` statement to obtain the `PreparedStatement` from the `Connection` object. In a `catch` block, catch an `Exception` object. `Rollback` the transaction and throw a `new DbException`, passing in the `Exception` object as the cause.

    &emsp;e. Inside the (currently) innermost `try-with-resource` statement, add a `try-with-resource` statement to obtain a `ResultSet` from the `PreparedStatement`. Include the import statement for `ResultSet`. It is in the `java.sql` package.

    &emsp;f. Inside the new innermost `try-with-resource`, create and return a `List` of `Project`s.

    &emsp;g. Loop through the result set. Create and assign each result row to a new `Project` object. Add the `Project` object to the `List` of `Project`s. You can do this by calling the `extract` method:

    ```java
    while (rs.next()) {
        projects.add(extract(rs, Project.class));
    }
    ```

    or by doing it manually like this:

    ```java
    while (rs.next()) {
        Project project = new Project();

        project.setActualHours(rs.getBigDecimal("actual_hours"));
        project.setDifficulty(rs.getObject("difficulty", Integer.class));
        project.setEstimatedHours(rs.getBigDecimal("estimated_hours"));
        project.setNotes(rs.getString("notes"));
        project.setProjectId(rs.getObject("project_id", Integer.class));
        project.setProjectName(rs.getString("project_name"));

        projects.add(project);
    }
    ```

## Test it

Test your solution by running `ProjectsApp`. Select "`List projects`". The app should return a list of projects that you have created. Make sure that you have created at least one project. Include in your video a shot of the console with the menu selections, your input, and the listed project(s). :camera:

## Select a project

In this section you will write code to select a current project. With a current project selected, you will be able to add materials, steps, and categories in future exercises. This will involve more code than it sounds like on the surface. When you select a current project using the project ID, you will query the project tables to fetch all project details (materials, steps, and categories) within a single transaction.

### Modifications to menu app

In this section, you will add a new option to the selections available to the user. Then you will add a method to select the current project. After selecting the current project, you will modify the `printOperations()` method to display the currently selected project, if any. It will print all project details including materials, steps, and categories.

In this section you will be working in `ProjectsApp.java`.

1. Add an instance variable of type `Project` named `curProject`.

2. Add a new operation: "`3) Select a project`".

3. Add a `case` to the `switch` to handle the operation. Call method `selectProject()`.

4. In this step you will create the method, `selectProject()`. This method will list the project IDs and names so that the user can select a project ID. Once the ID is entered, the service is called to return the project details. If successful, the current project is set to the returned project. Follow these instructions to write the method.

    Add a new method named `selectProject()`. It takes no parameters and returns nothing.

    &emsp;a. Call `listProjects()` to print a `List` of `Project`s.

    &emsp;b. Collect a project ID from the user and assign it to an `Integer` variable named `projectId`. Prompt the user with "`Enter a project ID to select a project`".

    &emsp;c. Set the instance variable `curProject` to `null` to unselect any currently selected project. This is done in case the call to the service results in an exception being thrown. Rather than leave the current project selected in that case, it is unselected first.

    &emsp;d. Call a new method, `fetchProjectById()` on the `projectService` object. The method should take a single parameter, the project ID input by the user. It should return a `Project` object. Assign the returned `Project` object to the instance variable `curProject`. Note that if an invalid project ID is entered, `projectService.fetchProjectById()` will throw a `NoSuchElementException`, which is handled by the catch block in `processUserSelections()`.

    &emsp;e. At the end of the method, add a check to see if `curProject` is `null`. If so, print "`Invalid project ID selected.`" on the console.

    &emsp;<details><summary>f. The method should look like this:</summary>

    ```java
    private void selectProject() {
        listProjects();
        Integer projectId = getIntInput("Enter a project ID to select a project");

        /* Unselect the current project. */
        curProject = null;

        /* This will throw an exception if an invalid project ID is entered. */
        curProject = projectService.fetchProjectById(projectId);
    }
    ```

    </details>

5. In this step, you will add code to print the current project when the available menu selections are displayed to the user. To do this, find the method `printOperations()`. At the bottom of method `printOperations()`, check if `curProject` is `null`. If `null`, print a message: "`\nYou are not working with a project.`". Otherwise, print the message: `"\nYou are working with project: " + curProject`.

<details><summary>Code:</summary>

```java
if (Objects.isNull(curProject)) {
    System.out.println("\nYou are not working with a project.");
} else {
    System.out.println("\nYou are working with project: " + curProject);
}
```

</details>

### Modifications to project service

In this section you will create a method in the project service that will call the DAO to retrieve a single `Project` object with all details, including materials, steps, and categories. This method will throw an exception if the project with the given ID does not exist.

Note that you will temporarily assign the results of a method call to the DAO to an `Optional<Project>` object. This will cause Eclipse to create the return type on the DAO method as `Optional<Project>`. Once the method has been created, you can delete the assignment and return the `Project`, if successful. If not successful, the method will throw a `NoSuchElementException`.

In this section you will be working in `ProjectService.java`.

1. Create method `fetchProjectById()`. It returns a `Project` object and takes an `Integer projectId` as a parameter. Inside the method:

    &emsp;a. Temporarily assign a variable of type `Optional<Project>` to the results of calling `projectDao.fetchProjectById()`. Pass the project ID to the method.

    ```java
    Optional<Project> op = projectDao.fetchProjectById(projectId);
    ```

    &emsp;This temporary assignment will cause Eclipse to create the correct return value (`Optional<Project>`) in `ProjectService.java`.

    &emsp;b. Let Eclipse create the method for you in the `ProjectDao` class. The editor will display `ProjectDao.java`. Return to `ProjectService.java`. Save all files.

    &emsp;c. Replace the variable and assignment with a `return` statement. This will cause a compilation error, which you will correct next.

    &emsp;d. Add a method call to `.orElseThrow()` just inside the semicolon at the end of the method call to `projectDao.fetchProjectById()`. Use a zero-argument Lambda expression inside the call to `.orElseThrow()` to create and return a new `NoSuchElementException` with the custom message, `"Project with project ID=" + projectId + " does not exist."`.

    &emsp;<details><summary>The method should look like this:</summary>

    ```java
    public Project fetchProjectById(Integer projectId) {
        return projectDao.fetchProjectById(projectId).orElseThrow(
            () -> new NoSuchElementException(
                "Project with project ID=" + projectId + " does not exist."));
    }
    ```

    </details>

    Save all files. At this point there should be no compilation errors.

### Modifications to `ProjectDao`

In this section you will write the code that will retrieve a project row and all associated child rows: materials, steps, and categories. The method will start with the usual `try-with-resource` statement to obtain the `Connection`. Then you will add a `try/catch` before obtaining the `PreparedStatement`. This is done so that after obtaining the project details, the materials, steps, and categories can be retrieved within the same transaction.

If you get stuck and don't understand the instructions, please refer to the "Solutions" section at the end of this assignment.

In this section you will be working in `ProjectDao.java`.

1. In the method `fetchProjectById()`:

    &emsp;a. Write the SQL statement to return all columns from the project table in the row that matches the given `projectId`. Make sure to use the parameter placeholder "`?`" in the SQL statement.

    &emsp;b. Obtain a `Connection` object in a `try-with-resource` statement. Add the `catch` block to handle the `SQLException`. In the `catch` block throw a `new DbException` passing the `SQLException` object as a parameter.

    &emsp;c. Start a transaction inside the `try-with-resource` statement.

    &emsp;d. Below the method call to `startTransaction()`, add an inner `try/catch`. The `catch` block should handle `Exception`. Inside the `catch` block, `rollback` the transaction and throw a `new DbException` that takes the `Exception` object as a parameter.

    &emsp;e. Inside the `try` block, create a variable of type `Project` and set it to `null`. Return the `Project` object as an `Optional` object using `Optional.ofNullable()`. Save the file. You should have no compilation errors at this point but you may see some warnings. This is OK.

    &emsp;<details><summary>Here is the method at this point.</summary>

    ```java
    public Optional<Project> fetchProjectById(Integer projectId) {
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM " + PROJECT_TABLE + " WHERE project_id = ?";

        try (Connection conn = DbConnection.getConnection()) {
            startTransaction(conn);

            try {
                Project project = null;

                return Optionial.ofNullable(project);
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                rollbackTransaction(conn);
                throw new DbException(e);
            }
        }
        catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new DbException(e);
        }
    }
    ```

    </details>

    &emsp;f. Inside the inner `try` block, obtain a `PreparedStatement` from the `Connection` object in a `try-with-resource` statement. Pass the SQL statement in the method call to `prepareStatement()`. Add the `projectId` method parameter as a parameter to the `PreparedStatement`.

    &emsp;g. Obtain a `ResultSet` in a `try-with-resource` statement. If the `ResultSet` has a row in it (`rs.next()`) set the `Project` variable to a `new Project` object and set all fields from values in the `ResultSet`. You can call the `extract()` method for this.

    &emsp;h. Below the `try-with-resource` statement that obtains the `PreparedStatement` but inside the `try` block that manages the `rollback`, add three method calls to obtain the list of materials, steps, and categories. Since each method returns a `List` of the appropriate type, you can call `addAll()` to add the entire `List` to the `List` in the `Project` object:

    ```java
    project.getMaterials().addAll(fetchMaterialsForProject(conn, projectId));
    ```

    &emsp;i. Commit the transaction.

    &emsp;<details><summary>Here's what the method should look like now:</summary>

    ```java
    public Optional<Project> fetchProjectById(Integer projectId) {
        String sql = "SELECT * FROM " + PROJECT_TABLE + " WHERE project_id = ?";

        try (Connection conn = DbConnection.getConnection()) {
            startTransaction(conn);

            try {
                Project project = null;

                try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
                    setParameter(stmt, 1, projectId, Integer.class);

                    try (ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery()) {
                        if (rs.next()) {
                            project = extract(rs, Project.class);
                        }
                    }
                }

                if (Objects.nonNull(project)) {
                    project.getMaterials().addAll(fetchMaterialsForProject(conn, projectId));
                    project.getSteps().addAll(fetchStepsForProject(conn, projectId));
                    project.getCategories().addAll(fetchCategoriesForProject(conn, projectId));
                }

                commitTransaction(conn);

                return Optional.ofNullable(project);
            }
            catch (Exception e) {
                rollbackTransaction(conn);
                throw new DbException(e);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            throw new DbException(e);
        }
    }
    ```

    </details>

2. In this step you will write the methods that will return materials, steps, and categories as Lists. Each method is structured similarly. Since the `Connection` object is passed into each method, you won't have to obtain the `Connection` from `DbConnection.getConnection()`.

    Also, you won't need to add `catch` blocks to the `try-with-resource` statements because the caller makes the method calls within a `try` block. It won't hurt to catch the `SQLException` and turn it into an unchecked exception as you have been doing. But it won't hurt to simply declare the exception in the method signature either. It's your choice.

    So, this:

    ```java
    private List<Material> fetchMaterialsForProject(Connection conn, Integer projectId) throws SQLException {};
    ```

    versus this:

    ```java
    try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
    }
    catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new DbException(e);
    }
    ```

    Follow these instructions to write the three methods to return materials, steps, and categories. Each method should return a `List` of the appropriate type. At this point there should be no compilation errors.

    &emsp;a. Each method should take the `Connection` and the project ID as parameters.

    &emsp;b. Each method should return a `List` of the appropriate type (i.e., `List<Material>`).

    &emsp;c. Each method is written in the same way as the other query methods with the exception that the `Connection` is passed as a parameter, so you don't need to call `DbConnection.getConnection()` to obtain it.

    &emsp;d. Each method can add `throws SQLException` to the method declaration. This is because the method call to each method is within a `try/catch` block.

    &emsp;<details><summary>e. Here is a sample method (all three methods should have the identical structure). However, when you fetch the categories, you will need to join with the `project_category` join table as shown below:</summary>

    ```java
    private List<Category> fetchCategoriesForProject(Connection conn, Integer projectId) throws SQLException {
        // @formatter:off
        String sql = ""
            + "SELECT c.* FROM " + CATEGORY_TABLE + " c "
            + "JOIN " + PROJECT_CATEGORY_TABLE + " pc USING (category_id) "
            + "WHERE project_id = ?";
        // @formatter:on

        try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
            setParameter(stmt, 1, projectId, Integer.class);

            try (ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery()) {
                List<Category> categories = new LinkedList<>();

                while (rs.next()) {
                    categories.add(extract(rs, Category.class));
                }

                return categories;
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    </details>

## Test it

Now it's time to test that the code works. Since you haven't written the code to add materials, steps, and categories yet, you will have to add some rows manually.

### Instructions for DBeaver

1. Create a connection to the projects schema in DBeaver if you haven't already.

2. Right-click on the connection name and select "SQL Editor" / "New SQL script".

### The test

1. Add one or more categories. You don't have to enter the category ID; MySQL will manage that for you.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO category (category_name) VALUES ('Doors and Windows');
    ```

2. Make sure you have added one or more projects. In the editor type this to find a valid `project_id`:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM project;
    ```

3. Add one or more `material` records. If your `project_id` is `1`, enter something like this:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO material (project_id, material_name, num_required, cost)
    VALUES
        (1, '2-inch screws', 20, 1.09);
    ```

4. Add one or more `step` records. If your `project_id` is `1`, enter something like the following:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO step (project_id, step_text, step_order)
    VALUES
        (1, 'Screw door hangers on the top and bottom of each side of the door frame', 1);
    ```

5. Add one or more `project_category` records. This is a join table that contains two foreign keys. One foreign key points to a `project` row and the other points to a `category` row. So, if your project ID is `1` and the category ID for `'Doors and Windows'` is `1`, enter the join row like this:

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO project_category (project_id, category_id)
    VALUES
        (1, 1);
    ```

6. Run `ProjectsApp` as a Java application. Enter "`3`" to select a project. Enter a project ID. Include in your video that the project is selected. :camera: It should look something like this:

    <details><summary>Console output:</summary>

    ```
    These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
        1) Add a project
        2) List projects
        3) Select a project

    You are not working with a project.
    Enter a menu selection: 3
    Connection to schema 'projects' is successful.

    Projects:
        1: Hang a door
    Enter a project ID to select a project: 1
    Connection to schema 'projects' is successful.

    These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
        1) Add a project
        2) List projects
        3) Select a project

    You are working with project:
        ID=1
        name=Hang a door
        estimatedHours=4.00
        actualHours=3.00
        difficulty=3
        notes=Use the door hangers from Home Depot
        Materials:
            ID=1, materialName=Door in frame, numRequired=1, cost=null
            ID=2, materialName=Package of door hangers from Home Depot, numRequired=1, cost=null
            ID=3, materialName=2-inch screws, numRequired=20, cost=null
        Steps:
            ID=1, stepText=Align hangers on opening side of door vertically on the wall
            ID=2, stepText=Screw hangers into frame
        Categories:
            ID=1, categoryName=Doors and windows
            ID=2, categoryName=Repairs
    Enter a menu selection:

    You should see project details, a list of materials, a list of steps, and a list of categories. If you do not get a result like that shown above, check the console for errors. If you can't figure it out there are two things you can try:

    - In the `catch` block in method `processUserSelection()`, print the entire stack trace of the exception like this:

    ```java
    catch(Exception e) {
        System.out.println("\nError: " + e + " Try again.");

        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```

    - Start the application in debug mode. Load `ProjectsApp.java` into the editor. Right-click in editor and select "Debug As" / "Java Application". Set breakpoints as appropriate. Work through the application until you find the error.

    - This article on debugging is a little dated but still applicable. You don't need to worry about the section on remote debugging. https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php

7. Now test with an invalid project ID. Run the application. Enter "`3`" to select a project. Enter an invalid number. Include in your video a shot of the console. :camera: It should look something like the screen shot below.

    ```
    These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
        1) Add a project
        2) List projects
        3) Select a project

    You are not working with a project.
    Enter a menu selection: 3
    Connection to schema 'projects' is successful.

    Projects:
        1: Hang a door
    Enter a project ID to select a project: 99
    Connection to schema 'projects' is successful.

    Error: projects.exception.DbException: Project with project ID=99 does not exist. Try again.

    These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
        1) Add a project
        2) List projects
        3) Select a project

    You are not working with a project.
    Enter a menu selection:
    Exiting the menu.
    ```
