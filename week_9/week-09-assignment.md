# Week 9 Coding Assignment

Building on the `projects` database project for week 9.

## Background

In the homework exercises, you are creating an application that will perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on a MySQL database. This application connects to a DIY Project database and demonstrates many features of SQL and JDBC. Learning these skills will help prepare you for using these skills in the workplace.

As a reminder, in the last two weeks you used JDBC to connect to a MySQL database. Then, you diagrammed the project tables using Draw.io. Lastly, you wrote the `CREATE TABLE` statements for the five tables and created the tables in DBeaver.

In this week's exercises, you will begin development of the menu-driven application. You will use proper exception handling to gracefully manage any errors. You will write code to add project details to the project tables. This will involve properly creating and managing JDBC resources as well as database transactions.

In future exercises you will write code to read from a single table as well as from joined tables. Finally, you will write code to update and delete table rows.

### Objectives

In these exercises, you will:

-   Learn to write a menu-driven application with correct exception handling.
-   Implement a scanner to gather user input from the console.
-   Learn how to work with `BigDecimal` objects.
-   Use JDBC to correctly handle resources (`Connection`s and `PreparedStatement`s) ensuring that they are closed properly.
-   Implement JDBC methods to insert a `Project` object into the `project` table.

### Instructions

Follow the **Exercises** below to complete this assignment.

-   In Eclipse, or an IDE of your choice, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below. Ensure that the code compiles and runs as directed.

-   Using the repository you created in week 7, push your completed code to this dedicated repo, including your entire Maven Project Directory (e.g., mysql-java) and any .sql files that you create.

-   Include the functionality into your Video when you see: :camera:

-   Create a video showcasing your work:

    -   In this video: record and present your project verbally while showing the results of the working project. Donâ€™t forget to include the requested functionality, indicated by: :camera:

    -   **_Easy way to Create a video:_** Start a meeting in Zoom, share your screen, open Eclipse with the code and your Console window, start recording & record yourself describing and running the program showing the results. When you click "End Meeting" it will save the video on your computer.

    -   Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.

    -   This video should be done using screen share and voice over.

    -   This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube. Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!

    -   (If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.)

### Important

In the exercises below, you will see this icon: :camera: .

This means to make sure that you include this functionality in your video showcase.

## Exercises

In these exercises you will write code to create a menu-driven application. You will display menu selections to the user and will write the code to add project details to the DIY project tables. This will demonstrate the use of the `INSERT` statement (the Create part of CRUD).

Complete these exercises as directed. If you get hopelessly stuck, please see the "Solutions" section below.

In these exercises, you will often be told to call a method prior to creating it. This is a good approach. You set up the return type by assigning to a variable and set up the parameters. Then, Eclipse can correctly create the method.

### Cleanup

In this section, you are working with `ProjectsApp.java` in the `projects` package.

1. Delete the debugging line (`DbConnection.getConnection();`) in the main method. The method should now be empty.

2. Remove the import statement: `import projects.dao.DbConnection;`

### Build the Menu Application

The exercises in this section build a menu-driven application. This application displays a list of available operations. The user selects which operation to perform. A switch statement then routes the selection to the appropriate method. Along the way you will add in proper exception handling. This is an important step to get right when building any application.

The purpose of the menu application is to perform CRUD operations on a relational database that holds information on DIY projects. Throughout the coming weeks you will add to this application to insert project rows, then materials, steps, and categories. You will fetch projects as a list and fetch an individual project with all the details. You will modify rows and delete an entire project with all associated detail (i.e. child) rows.

In this section, you are working with `ProjectsApp.java` in the `projects` package.

1.  In order to display a list of menu options you must store them somewhere. In this step you will write the code that holds the list of operations.

    &emsp;a. Add a private instance variable named `operations`. The type is `List<String>`. Initialize it using `List.of` with the following value: `1) Add a project`. To prevent the Eclipse formatter from reformatting the list, surround the variable declaration with `// @formatter:off` and `// @formatter:on` so that it looks like this:

    ```java
    // @formatter:off
    private List<String> operations = List.of(
        "1) Add a project"
    );
    // @formatter:on
    ```

    This list of operations will be printed on the console so that the user will be reminded which selection to make.

2.  In this step you will use a `Scanner` to obtain input from a user from the Java console. A `Scanner` is a Java object that can be used to read from a variety of sources. When you create the `Scanner`, you will set its input source to `System.in`, which is the opposite of `System.out`. You use `System.out` to print to the console. You will use the `Scanner` to read _from_ the console. So, the user types in selections and the `Scanner` reads the input and gives it to the application.

    &emsp;Add a `private` instance variable named `scanner`. It is of type `java.util.Scanner`. Initialize it to a `new Scanner` object. Pass `System.in` to the constructor. This will set the scanner so that it accepts user input from the Java console. It should look like this:

    ```java
    private Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    ```

3.  In this step you will call the method that processes the menu. In the `main()` method, create a new `ProjectsApp` object and call the method `processUserSelections()`. The method takes zero parameters and returns nothing:

    ```java
    new ProjectsApp().processUserSelections();
    ```

4.  Now you can create the `processUserSelections()` method as an instance method. This method displays the menu selections, gets a selection from the user, and then acts on the selection. Let Eclipse create the method for you by waving your mouse over the compiler error in the `main()` method _(i.e. over the red squigglies)_. Eclipse will pop up a menu. Select "`Create method processUserSelections()`".

    In method `processUserSelections()`:

    &emsp;a. Add a local variable:

    ```java
    boolean done = false;
    ```

    &emsp;b. Add a `while` loop below the local variable. Loop until the variable `done` is true:

    ```java
    while (!done) {
        // loop body
    }
    ```

    &emsp;c. Inside the `while` loop, add a `try/catch` block. The `catch` block should catch `Exception`. Inside the `catch` block print the `Exception` message. Call the `toString()` method on the `Exception` object provided to the `catch` block. This is done by simply concatenating the `Exception` object onto a `String` literal. When you do this Java implicitly calls the `toString()` method behind the scenes.

    &emsp;d. Inside the `try` block, assign an `int` variable named `selection` to the return value from the method `getUserSelection()`.

    &emsp;<details><summary>The method should now look like this:</summary>

    ```java
    private void processUserSelections() {
        boolean done = false;

        while (!done) {
            try {
                int selection = getUserSelection();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("\nError: " + e + " Try again.");
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    </details>

5.  Create the method `getUserSelection()`. It takes no parameters and returns an `int`. This method will print the `operations` and then accept user input as an `Integer`. In the `getUserSelection()` method:

    &emsp;a. Make a method call to the method `printOperations()`. This method takes no parameters and returns nothing.

    &emsp;b. Add a method call to `getIntInput()`. Assign the results of the method call to a variable named `input` of type `Integer`. The method `getIntInput()`, which you haven't written yet. It will return the user's menu selection. The value may be `null`. Pass the `String` literal "`Enter a menu selection`" as a parameter to the method.

    &emsp;c. Add a return statement that checks to see if the value in local variable `input` is `null`. If so, return `-1`. _(The value_ `-1` _will signal the menu processing method to exit the application)._ Otherwise, return the value of `input`.

    &emsp;<details><summary>The method should look like this:</summary>

    ```java
    private int getUserSelection() {
        printOperations();

        Integer input = getIntInput("Enter a menu selection");

        return Objects.isNull(input) ? -1 : input;
    }
    ```

    </details>

6.  Create the method `printOperations()`. It takes no parameters and returns nothing. This method does just what it says: it prints each available selection on a separate line in the console. In the `printOperations()` method:

    &emsp;a. Print a line to the console:

    ```java
    "\nThese are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:");
    ```

    &emsp;b. Print all the available menu selections, one on each line. Each line should be indented slightly (2 or 3 spaces). Use any strategy that you choose to print the instructions. If you use a Lambda expression as shown in the video, it should look like this:

    ```java
    operations.forEach(line -> System.out.println("   " + line));
    ```

    &emsp;Every List object must implement the `forEach()` method. `forEach()` takes a `Consumer` interface object as a parameter. `Consumer` has a single abstract method, `accept()`. The `accept()` method takes a single parameter and returns nothing. The Lambda expression has a single parameter and `System.out.println` returns nothing. The Lambda expression thus matches the requirements for the `accept()` method.

    &emsp;If you don't want to use a Lambda expression, you can use an enhanced `for` loop to print the instructions.

7.  There will be several user input methods that return different types of objects. Due to the way the `java.util.Scanner` object was implemented, the safest way to get an input line from the user is to input it as a `String` and then convert it to the appropriate type. With this design, all the input methods will ultimately call the `String` input method, which actually prints the prompt and uses the Scanner to get the user's input. In this step, you will write a method that returns an `Integer` value.

    &emsp;Create the method `getIntInput`. It takes a single parameter of type `String` named `prompt`. This method accepts input from the user and converts it to an `Integer`, which may be `null`. It is called by `getUserSelection()` and will be called by other data collection methods that require an `Integer`. Inside the method body:

    &emsp;a. Assign a local variable named `input` of type `String` to the results of the method call `getStringInput(prompt)`.

    &emsp;b. Test the value in the variable `input`. If it is `null`, return `null`. Use `Objects.isNull()` for the `null` check.

    &emsp;c. Create a `try/catch` block to test that the value returned by `getStringInput()` can be converted to an `Integer`. The `catch` block should accept a parameter of type `NumberFormatException`.

    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;i. In the `try` block, convert the value of `input`, which is a `String`, to an `Integer` and return it. If the conversion is not possible, a `NumberFormatException` is thrown. The message in the `NumberFormatException` is totally obscure, so it will get fixed in the `catch` block. Here's what the contents of the `try` block should look like:

    ```java
    return Integer.valueOf(input);
    ```

    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ii. In the `catch` block throw a new `DbException` with the message, "`input + " is not a valid number. Try again.`"

    &emsp;<details><summary>d. The method should look like this:</summary>

    ```java
    private Integer getIntInput(String prompt) {
        String input = getStringInput(prompt);

        if (Objects.isNull(input)) {
            return null;
        }

        try {
            return Integer.valueOf(input);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            throw new DbException(input + " is not a valid number.");
        }
    }
    ```

    </details>

8.  Now create the method that really prints the prompt and gets the input from the user. Create the method `getStringInput()`. It should have a single parameter of type `String` named `prompt`. This is the lowest level input method. The other input methods call this method and convert the input value to the appropriate type. This will also be called by methods that need to collect `String` data from the user. It should return a `String`. Inside the method:

    &emsp;a. Print the prompt using `System.out.print(prompt + ": ")` to keep the cursor on the same line as the prompt. _(Note:_ `print` _and not_ `println`_!)_

    &emsp;b. Assign a `String` variable named `input` to the results of a method call to `scanner.nextLine()`.

    &emsp;c. Test the value of `input`. If it is blank return `null`. Otherwise return the trimmed value.

&emsp;<details><summary>d. The method should look like this:</summary>

    ```java
    private String getStringInput(String prompt) {
        System.out.print(prompt + ": ");
        String input = scanner.nextLine();

        return input.isBlank() ? null : input.trim();
    }
    ```

</details>

&emsp;e. At this point the file should have no compile errors.

9. Now we want to add code that will process the user's selection. Since the user enters an `Integer` value (the menu selection number) you can use a `switch` statement to process the selection.

    Back in the method `processUserSelections()`:

    &emsp;a. Add a `switch` statement below the method call to `getUserSelection()`. Create a `switch` statement to switch on the value in the local variable `selection`.

    &emsp;b. Add the first case of` -1`. Inside this case, call `exitMenu()` and assign the result of the method call to the local variable `done`. Make sure to add the `break` statement.

    &emsp;c. Add the `default` case. Print a message: `"\n" + selection + " is not a valid selection. Try again."`.

10. Now that the menu code has been written you will need to test it to see if it works. Test the application two ways:

    &emsp;a. This will test that a non-integer selection prints an error message and gracefully recovers. Run the application. Click in the Eclipse console so that input will go to the scanner. Enter "`abc`" (without quotes) and press `Enter`. You should get an error message and be prompted again to enter a valid selection. Now press `Enter` with no input. The application should quit. Include the application output in your video :camera: .

    &emsp;<details><summary>It should look something like this:</summary>

    ```
    These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
       1) Add a project
    Enter a menu selection: abc

    Error: projects.exception.DbException: abc is not a valid number. Try again.

    These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
       1) Add a project
    Enter a menu selection:
    Exiting the menu.
    ```

    </details>

    &emsp;b. This will test that entering a valid `Integer` without a corresponding `case` statement will print an error message and recover gracefully. Run the application. Click in the Eclipse console so that input will go to the scanner. Enter "`5`" (without quotes) and press `Enter`. You should get an error message and be prompted again to enter a valid selection. Now press `Enter` with no input. The application should quit. Include this application output in your video :camera: .

    &emsp;<details><summary>It should look something like this:</summary>

    ```
    These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
       1) Add a project
    Enter a menu selection: 5

    5 is not a valid number. Try again.

    These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
       1) Add a project
    Enter a menu selection:
    Exiting the menu.
    ```

    </details>

### Add project files from student resources

Promineo Tech has provided some resources so that you don't have to write every bit of code. In this section, you will add files into the `mysql-java` project from the student resources.

1. Drag the four files from the student resources `/Homework/entity` folder and drop them onto the `projects.entity` package in the Eclipse project. You may need to expand some folders in the package explorer to make the `projects.entity` package visible. When done you should see `Category.java`, `Material.java`, `Project.java`, and `Step.java` in the `projects.entity` package. There should be no errors visible in those files.

2. Drag the directory named "`provided`" from the student resources `/Homework` folder and drop it onto `src/main/java` in the package explorer. When done, there should be a new package named `provided.util` with a single file in it named `DaoBase.java`.

### Add a new project to the project table

You will now write the code to collect project information, create the project entities, and insert the project row into the project table.

### Modifications to the main application file

This section will collect project information from the user and call the service class (not written yet) to store the project row. In this section you will be introduced to the `BigDecimal` class if you haven't seen it before.

The `BigDecimal` class exactly represents decimal numbers _(numbers with decimal places)_. In this, the decimal numbers act like `Integer`s with a known number of decimal places. Money is a good example of this. Your bank may perform operations on money that results in fractional pennies, but at the end of the day your account is credited or debited with an exact dollar and penny amount. Fractional pennies are transitive and are not persisted to your account.

The `BigDecimal` object is perfectly suited to handle the SQL `DECIMAL` data type. `DECIMAL` values have a fixed number of digits (precision) and a fixed number of decimal places (scale). In the `CREATE TABLE` statement, a column definition of `DECIMAL (5, 2)` means that the value can range from `-999.99` to `999.99`. There are a maximum of five digits (precision) with two decimal places (scale).

`BigDecimal` contains immutable values â€“ once created they cannot be changed. Any operation performed on `BigDecimal` results in a new `BigDecimal` object. `BigDecimal`s can be created using a constructor, then the scale can be set by calling the `setScale()` method. To set the scale to `2` (two decimal places) do something like this:

```java
BigDecimal bd = new BigDecimal("1234.5678").setScale(2);
```

The JDBC driver has methods to natively handle `BigDecimal`. The driver automatically converts from Java `BigDecimal` to SQL `DECIMAL` and vice versa.

In this section you will be working in `ProjectsApp.java`.

1. At the top of the class, add a private instance variable of type `ProjectService` named `projectService` and call the zero-argument constructor to initialize it. Let Eclipse create the `ProjectService` class. Make sure the class is created in the `projects.service` package.

    - (_Hint:_ wave the mouse over `ProjectService`, which should have red squigglies under it. When the menu pops up, click "Create class '`ProjectService`'". When the Java Class wizard pops up, change the value in the field "Package" from "`projects`" to "`projects.service`").
    - The editor will switch over to `ProjectService.java`. Switch back to `ProjectsApp.java`.

2. In this step, you will add code in the `switch` statement to handle user selection "`1`", which will call a method to collect project details and save them in the project table.

    In the method `processUserSelections()`, add `case 1` to the switch statement. Inside the case, call the method `createProject()`. This method takes no parameters and returns nothing. Remember to add the `break` statement.

3. Now write the method to gather the project details from the user. Once collected, they will be put into a `Project` object. Then, another method will be called to save the project details.

    Create the method `createProject()`. It is `private`, takes no parameters, and returns nothing. In this method:

    &emsp;a. Add local variable `String projectName`. Assign the value to the result of calling `getStringInput("Enter the project name")`.

    &emsp;b. Add local variable `BigDecimal estimatedHours`. Assign the value to the result of calling `getDecimalInput("Enter the estimated hours")`. You may need to add the import statement for `BigDecimal`. It is in the `java.math` package.

    &emsp;c. Add local variable `BigDecimal actualHours`. Assign the value to the result of calling `getDecimalInput("Enter the actual hours")`.

    &emsp;d. Add local variable `Integer difficulty`. Assign the value to the result of calling `getIntInput("Enter the project difficulty (1-5)")`. Note that the instructions don't include code to validate that the input is valid. You can do this if you want.

    &emsp;e. Add local variable `String notes`. Assign the value to the result of calling `getStringInput("Enter the project notes")`.

    &emsp;f. Create a new variable of type `Project` named `project`. Initialize it to a `new Project` object by calling the zero-argument constructor. Import the `Project` class from the `projects.entity` package. The `Project` class should have been added to the Eclipse project in the section _"Add project files from student resources."_ If Eclipse can't find the import, follow the instructions in that section.

    &emsp;g. Call the appropriate setters on the `Project` object to set `projectName`, `estimatedHours`, `actualHours`, `difficulty` and `notes`. For example, to add the project name on the `Project` object, call `setProjectName()` and pass it `projectName`.

    &emsp;h. Call the `addProject()` method on the `projectService` object. Pass it the `Project` object. This method will be created shortly. This method should return an object of type `Project`. Assign it to variable `dbProject`.

    &emsp;i. Print a success message to the console `"You have successfully created project: " + dbProject`. The value returned from `projectService.addProject()` is different from the `Project` object passed to the method. It contains the project ID that was added by MySQL.

    &emsp;<details><summary>The method should look like this. (There will be an error on the line that calls the `projectService` object and the lines that call `getDecimalInput()`):</summary>

    ```java
    private void createProject() {
        String projectName = getStringInput("Enter the project name");
        BigDecimal estimatedHours = getDecimalInput("Enter the estimated hours");
        BigDecimal actualHours = getDecimalInput("Enter the actual hours");
        Integer difficulty = getIntInput("Enter the project difficulty (1-5)");
        String notes = getStringInput("Enter the project notes");

        Project project = new Project();

        project.setProjectName(projectName);
        project.setEstimatedHours(estimatedHours);
        project.setActualHours(actualHours);
        project.setDifficulty(difficulty);
        project.setNotes(notes);

        Project dbProject = projectService.addProject(project);
        System.out.println("You have successfully created project: " + dbProject);
    }
    ```

    </details>

4. To get rid of the compilation errors, you will need to create two methods. In this step you will create the method `getDecimalInput()`.

    &emsp;Create the method `getDecimalInput()`. The easiest way to do this is to create the method body, then copy the method contents from `getIntInput()` and paste it into the method body. Fix the following lines:

    &emsp;a. The line in the `try` block. Change it to:

    ```java
    return new BigDecimal(input).setScale(2);
    ```

    &emsp;This will create a new `BigDecimal` object and set the number of decimal places (the scale) to `2`.

    &emsp;b. The message in `DbException`. Change it to:

    ```java
    input + " is not a valid decimal number."
    ```

5. Now create the second method that will fix the compilation errors. Wave the mouse over "`projectService.addProject()`". When the menu pops up, select "`Add method 'addProject(project)' in type 'ProjectService'`".

6. Save all files. All compiler errors should now be gone.

### Modifications to project service

The service layer in this small application is implemented by a single file, `ProjectService.java`. Mostly, this file acts as a pass-through between the main application file that runs the menu (`ProjectsApp.java`) and the DAO file in the data layer (`ProjectDao.java`).

In this section you will be working in `ProjectService.java`.

1. In this step, you will create the DAO class and initialize a variable of that type. At the top of the class, add a private instance variable of type `ProjectDao` named `projectDao`. Assign the variable to a new `ProjectDao` object by calling the constructor with no parameters. If possible, let Eclipse create the class for you. In any event, create a `ProjectDao` class in the `projects.dao` package. Make sure that `ProjectDao` extends `DaoBase` from the `provided.util` package. Save all files. You should have no compile errors. The editor will probably change to the `ProjectDao` class. Change back to the `ProjectService` class.

2. In method `addProject()`, call the method `insertProject()` on the `projectDao` object. The method should take a single parameter. Pass it the `Project` parameter and return the value from the method. The `addProject()` method should look like this:

    ```java
    public Project addProject(Project project) {

    return projectDao.insertProject(project);

    }
    ```

3. Wave the mouse over `insertProject()` (with the red squigglies) and select "`Create method 'insertProject(Project)' in type 'ProjectDao'`". Save all files. You should have no compile errors.

### Modifications to project DAO

Now you want to create the class that will read and write to the MySQL database. In this section you will write the values that were collected from the user and that are contained in a `Project` object to the `project` table using JDBC method calls.

In this section you will be working in file `ProjectDao.java` in the `projects.dao` package. If you followed the steps above, `ProjectDao` should extend `DaoBase`. If it doesn't, do that now or you will run into problems later.

#### Add constants

First, you should add some constants with the table names. It's a good idea to add constants for values that are used over and over again in a class. The table names are used by all the methods that write to or read from the tables.

In this section, you will be adding constants into the `ProjectDao` class. These are placed at the top of the class just inside the class body. Java does not have a "constant" keyword. Instead, a constant is specified using `static final`. Constants can either be `public` or `private`. In this file all the constants should be `private`.

1. Add the constant for the category table named `CATEGORY_TABLE`. Set the value to "`category`".

2. Add the constant for the material table named `MATERIAL_TABLE`. Set the value to "`material`".

3. Add the constant for the project table named `PROJECT_TABLE`. Set the value to "`project`".

4. Add the constant for the project-category table named `PROJECT_CATEGORY_TABLE`. Set the value to "`project_category`".

5. Add the constant for the step table named `STEP_TABLE`. Set the value to "`step`".

The constants should look like this:

```java
private static final String CATEGORY_TABLE = "category";
private static final String MATERIAL_TABLE = "material";
private static final String PROJECT_TABLE = "project";
private static final String PROJECT_CATEGORY_TABLE = "project_category";
private static final String STEP_TABLE = "step";
```

#### Save the project details

There are several steps that must be taken to save the project details. First, you must create the SQL statement. Then you will obtain a `Connection` and start a transaction. Next you will obtain a `PreparedStatement` and set the parameter values from the `Project` object. Finally, you will save the data and commit the transaction. Follow the steps below to save the project details.

In this section, you will be working exclusively in the method `insertProject()` in `ProjectDao.java`.

1. Write the SQL statement that will insert the values from the `Project` object passed to the `insertProject()` method. Remember to use **question marks** as placeholder values for the parameters passed to the `PreparedStatement`. Add the fields `project_name`, `estimated_hours`, `actual_hours`, `difficulty`, and `notes`. Make sure to add the correct blank spaces between words or it won't work. It should look like this:

    ```java
    // @formatter:off
    String sql = ""
        + "INSERT_INTO " + PROJECT_TABLE + " "
        + "(project_name, estimated_hours, actual_hours, difficulty, notes) "
        + "VALUES "
        + "(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)"
    // @formatter:on
    ```

2. Obtain a connection from `DbConnection.getConnection()`. Assign it a variable of type `Connection` named `conn` in a `try-with-resource` statement. Catch the `SQLException` in a `catch` block added to the `try-with-resource`. From within the `catch` block, throw a new `DbException`. The `DbException` constructor should take the `SQLException` object passed into the `catch` block.

    ```java
    try (Connection conn = DbConnection.getConnection()) {
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        throw new DbException(e);
    }
    ```

3. Start a transaction. Inside the `try` block, start a transaction by calling `startTransaction()` and passing in the `Connection` object. `startTransaction()` is a method in the base class, `DaoBase`.

4. Obtain a `PreparedStatement` object from the `Connection` object. Inside the `try` block and below `startTransaction()`, add another `try-with-resource` statement to obtain a `PreparedStatement` from the `Connection` object.

    &emsp;a. Pass the SQL statement as a parameter to `conn.prepareStatement()`.

    &emsp;b. Add a `catch` block to the inner `try` block that catches `Exception`. In the `catch` block, roll back the transaction and throw a `DbException` initialized with the `Exception` object passed into the `catch` block. This will ensure that the transaction is rolled back when an exception is thrown.

    &emsp;<details><summary>c. The method should look like this at this point:</summary>

    ```java
    public Project insertProject(Project project) {
        // @formatter:off
        String sql = ""
            + "INSERT_INTO " + PROJECT_TABLE + " "
            + "(project_name, estimated_hours, actual_hours, difficulty, notes) "
            + "VALUES "
            + "(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)"
        // @formatter:on

        try (Connection conn = DbConnection.getConnection()) {
            startTransaction(conn); // Transaction started

            try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
            } catch (Exception e) {
                rollbackTransaction(conn); // Transaction rolled back
                throw new DbException(e);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new DbException(e);
        }
    }
    ```

    </details>

5. In this step you will set the project details as parameters in the `PreparedStatement` object. Inside the inner `try` block, set the parameters on the `Statement`. Use the convenience method in DaoBase `setParameter()`. This method handles `null` values correctly _(See the JavaDoc comments on that method for details)_. Add these parameters: `projectName`, `estimatedHours`, `actualHours`, `difficulty`, and `notes`.

    &emsp;<details><summary>When done it should look like this:</summary>

    ```java
    setParameter(stmt, 1, project.getProjectName(), String.class);
    setParameter(stmt, 2, project.getEstimatedHours(), BigDecimal.class);
    setParameter(stmt, 3, project.getActualHours(), BigDecimal.class);
    setParameter(stmt, 4, project.getDifficulty(), Integer.class);
    setParameter(stmt, 5, project.getNotes(), String.class);
    ```

    </details>

6. Now you can save the project details. Perform the insert by calling `executeUpdate()` on the `PreparedStatement` object. Do not pass any parameters to `executeUpdate()` or it will reset all the parameters leading to an obscure error.

7. Obtain the project ID (primary key) by calling the convenience method in `DaoBase`, `getLastInsertId()` _(See the JavaDoc documentation on that method for details)_. Pass the `Connection` object and the constant `PROJECT_TABLE` to `getLastInsertId()`. Assign the return value to an `Integer` variable named `projectId`.

8. Commit the transaction by calling the convenience method in `DaoBase`, `commitTransaction()`. Pass the `Connection` object to `commitTransaction()` as a parameter.

9. Set the `projectId` on the `Project` object that was passed into `insertProject` and return it. At this point there should be no compile errors. 

    <details><summary>The method should now look like this:</summary>

    ```java
    public Project insertProject(Project project) {
        // @formatter:off
        String sql = ""
            + "INSERT_INTO " + PROJECT_TABLE + " "
            + "(project_name, estimated_hours, actual_hours, difficulty, notes) "
            + "VALUES "
            + "(?, ?, ?, ?, ?)"
        // @formatter:on

        try (Connection conn = DbConnection.getConnection()) {
            startTransaction(conn); // Transaction started

            try (PreparedStatement stmt = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {
                setParameter(stmt, 1, project.getProjectName(), String.class);
                setParameter(stmt, 2, project.getEstimatedHours(), BigDecimal.class);
                setParameter(stmt, 3, project.getActualHours(), BigDecimal.class);
                setParameter(stmt, 4, project.getDifficulty(), Integer.class);
                setParameter(stmt, 5, project.getNotes(), String.class);

                stmt.executeUpdate();

                Integer projectId = getLastInsert(conn, PROJECT_TABLE);
                commitTransaction(conn);

                project.setProjectId(projectId);
                return project;

            } catch (Exception e) {
                rollbackTransaction(conn); // Transaction rolled back
                throw new DbException(e);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            throw new DbException(e);
        }
    }
    ```

### Test it

After all that coding, it's a good idea to test that it actually works. You need to ensure that you can add a project row to the project table with no errors.

1. Run the application.

2. Enter the menu selection "`1`".

3. Enter project name, estimated hours, actual hours, difficulty and notes.

4. Include in your video :camera: the console output showing the data entry and the printed Project object. It should look something like this:

<details><summary>Output:</summary>

```
These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
    1) Add a project
Enter a menu selection: 1
Enter the project name: Hang a door
Enter the estimated hours: 4
Enter the actual hours: 3
Enter the project difficulty (1-5): 3
Enter the project notes: Use the door hangers from Home Depot
Connection to schema 'projects' is successful.
You have successfully created project:
    ID=1
    name=Hang a door
    estimatedHours=4.00
    actualHours=3.00
    difficulty=3
    notes=Use the door hangers from Home Depot
    Materials:
    Steps:
    Categories:

These are the available selections. Press the Enter key to quit:
    1) Add a project
Enter a menu selection: 
Exiting the menu.
```
