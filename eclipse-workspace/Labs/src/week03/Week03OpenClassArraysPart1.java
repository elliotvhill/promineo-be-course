	 * Question 1: Add Them Up

Using the given Array of 5 integers named numbers and the given variable sum, print out the sum of all the elements in the Array.
Write a for loop that will iterate over the numbers Array and add each element of the Array to sum
Use System.out.println() to print the value of sum to the console
