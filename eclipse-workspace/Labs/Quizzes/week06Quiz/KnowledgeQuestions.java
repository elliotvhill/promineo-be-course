		 * Animal therefore a Cow Class can be created based on an Animal Class)
		 * 
		 * __ABSTRACTION__ is the concept of wrapping complex actions in simple verbs.
		 * It is also described as hiding implementation details and exposing only
		 * functionality to users. This means that a user will only know "what" is being
		 * done, not "how". 
		 * 
		 * __POLYMORPHISM__ is the condition of occurring in several different forms.
