## 1. OOP Concepts

### What is OOP?


**Object Oriented Programming** (**OOP**) is a programming paradigm. **Java** is an Object Oriented Language, which means that it supports **OOP**, providing features that support and implement the **Four Pillars of OOP**. 

In **OOP**, **objects** are the key construct in our programming, and these **objects** contain **properties** and **functionality**. Instead of writing code all in one place, we structure our program into **objects**. Each object will contain relevant **properties** and **functionality**, which is code that is structured into methods that can be used over and over.  

In **OOP**, programs are written by creating **objects** that contain both data (**properties**) and methods (**functionality**), in contrast with _procedural programming_ where data exists, and procedures and methods perform operations on the data.

It takes time to start to think of **data** as being stored in an **object** which also contains all of the **methods** written for that object. Another way to explain this is to think of an **object**, and imagine that everything that you need (data or methods) is accessible anytime you reference that **object**. If you have access to the **object**, you also have access to any available property and functionality that belong to that **object**.


### Terminology -- Classes vs. Objects:

**Classes** are the mechanism by which we structure our code in OOP.

* A **Class** is a blueprint, in which you create your properties and functionality.
* An **Object** is the actual product developed from the blueprint.  

An **Object** is an **instance** of a **Class**!

So, a **class** is a template for **objects**, and an **object** is an instance of a **class**. When we create an **object** from a **class**, that object will inherit everything in the **class**, including the properties and functionality.


### Description of a Class, and an Object created from the Class:

**Class:**  Animal

**Properties:**

* name
* weight
* type
* location

**Functionality:**

* `describe()`

**Object:**  dog 

A dog will be instantiated as an instance of the class, Animal.

```java
Animal dog = new Animal();
```


### Preview:

In the next chapter, **2. Classes**, you will find a Java example that creates a class _Animal_, and creates a class _AnimalMain_, in which we have a `main` method, as well as two objects created from the class _Animal_:  _elephant_ and _kangaroo_.
