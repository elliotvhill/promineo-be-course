## Prompts

1. What is a database? What is a schema? Compare and contrast?

    > A **database** is an application that stores and serves data — often referred to as the "back end". A database can have multiple schemas.
    > 
    > A **schema** is a specific, named collection of data within a database. The schema is kind of like a blueprint: it defines the structure of the data — the tables, fields, and relationships. <sup>[[1](#source-1)][[2](#source-2)]</sup>

2. What is a DBMS? What is an RDBMS? Compare and contrast.

    > **RDBMS** stands for **Relational Database Management System**. An RDBMS is software that is used to maintain and work with a database. <sup>[[6](#source-6)]</sup>

3. What is SQL? How is it used?

    > **SQL** is a programming language that is used to create and make queries to databases. SQL is used with an RDBMS (like MySQL, for example) to maintain and work with databases.

4. Our course uses MySQL. What is the difference between MySQL and SQL?

    > **SQL** is the actual programming language used to store and process data.
    > 
    > **MySQL** is a _tool_ — the system through which a database is managed. <sup>[[3](#source-3)][[5](#source-5)]</sup>

5. Describe MySQL? What type of database management system is it? What company owns it? What makes it unique?

    > MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS), and is owned by Oracle. <sup>[[4](#source-4)]</sup>
    > 
    > It is unique because it is open source, it is stable and secure, scaleable, and it is compatible with myriad platforms and tools. <sup>[[7](#source-7)]</sup>

6. How is data organized in an RDBMS? What are the constructs that allow users to easily organize and access data?

    > In an RDBMS, data is organized into tables of rows and columns. Relationships between tables are created using primary and foreign keys -- values that "link" data from one table to another.

7. What are ten different data types MySQL provides?

    > Date, Time, Year, JSON, integer, decimal, numeric, float, varchar (string), char (string) <sup>[[8](#source-8)]</sup>
