## Prompts

1. What does JPA stand for? Why is it useful? What problems does it solve?

    > **JPA** stands for **Java Persistence API**. It is an API that helps map Java objects to database tables and vice versa. <sup>[[1](#source-1)]</sup> It allows developers to interact with databases using Java objects, rather than having to write SQL queries. <sup>[[2](#source-2)]</sup> This saves developers time, and also keeps code cleaner and easier to read.

2. Compare JDBC & JPA. Compare and contrast the two approaches.

3. Why and where would using logging be useful? What library do we use in this course for logging?

4. What is Lombok? How is it used? What benefits come from using Lombok?

    > Lombok is a Java library that automatically generates boilerplate code, including getters, setters, and constructors. <sup>[[3](#source-3)]</sup> It is used by importing the library as a dependency in `pom.xml` and then by using specific annotations in the Java code. The biggest benefit of using Lombok is that it removes the need to write repetitive and boilerplate code, which makes code easier to read and maintain.
